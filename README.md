# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

This is a simple implementation of the popular game "Tic Tac Toe" using React. The project includes both client and server side code.

- A Tic-Tac-Toe game created in React is a web-based implementation of the classic game. It typically involves a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking "X" or "O" in empty cells.

- The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with one's symbol before the opponent. React facilitates the game's development by managing the game state, rendering the game board, handling user interactions, and determining the winner or a draw scenario.

- The game's simplicity and fundamental mechanics make it an excellent educational project for learning React's basics, state management, conditional rendering, and event handling within a familiar and straightforward context.
